# fivem-launcher-csharp

First, you will need to make a `button` in your C# Form.

Then, double click the button and put the following code: `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start($"fivem://connect/{IP}:{PORT}");`

`{IP}` stands for your FiveM server IP Address and `{PORT}` stands for your FiveM server port.

I'm not going to upload a source code, because it's really easy to make, the design is a bit harder tho.
